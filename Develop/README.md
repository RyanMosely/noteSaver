## Conclusion

From the get-go of starting this project, I had a really hard time understanding the concepts of how express.js works. I had trouble understanding how routing methods communicated with the front-end portion. I can now definitely see how having back-end support and utilizing routing methods works, by having these routing methods they will perform actions (front end) givin a particular routing path/route method. The main mistake I made when I initially started this project was that I wasn't aware that I did NOT need to use fs.readfile in order to read a file to send back to the client, I simply needed just to require the file. This project definitely was a learning process and I hope to get even better with express as time goes on.
